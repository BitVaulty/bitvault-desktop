# UTXO Selection Implementation

This document outlines the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) selection implementation in BitVault, including architecture, selection strategies, and implementation details.

## Architecture

The UTXO selection system follows a modular design with the following components:

1. **UTXOProvider**: Interface for retrieving available UTXOs
2. **UTXOSelector**: Core selection algorithms
3. **FeeCalculator**: Fee estimation based on transaction structure
4. **TransactionBuilder**: Creates transactions from selected UTXOs

This architecture allows for:
- Pluggable selection strategies
- Clean separation of concerns
- Testable components
- Platform-independent core logic

## Selection Strategies

BitVault implements several UTXO selection strategies:

### 1. Coin Selection Algorithms

- **Branch and Bound (BnB)**: Optimal solution for minimizing the number of inputs while meeting the target amount
- **Knapsack**: Optimized for fee minimization in specific scenarios
- **Largest-First**: Simple strategy selecting largest UTXOs first (prioritizes reducing input count)
- **Oldest-First**: Selects oldest UTXOs first (prioritizes UTXO consolidation)
- **Privacy-Enhanced**: Randomizes selection with certain constraints to enhance privacy

### 2. Fee Considerations

Fee estimation is critical for appropriate UTXO selection:

- Dynamic fee rate based on network conditions
- Weight-based calculation following Bitcoin Core's approach
- Fee bumping strategies for stuck transactions

### 3. Change Output Handling

The implementation carefully handles change outputs:

- Dust avoidance (prevents creating outputs that cost more in fees than their value)
- Change output consolidation strategies
- Minimum change thresholds

## Implementation Notes

### 1. Performance Optimizations

- Caching of UTXO data for repeated selections
- Pre-filtering of UTXOs based on simple criteria before running complex algorithms
- Efficient data structures for quick UTXO retrieval

### 2. Security Considerations

Several security measures are implemented:

- Preventing fee siphoning attacks
- Validation of UTXO ownership before selection
- Mitigation of transaction malleability issues
- Protection against dust-based DoS attacks

### 3. Implementation Cleanup

The following improvements were made to the original implementation:

- **Code Organization**: Moved selection logic to dedicated modules
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error reporting with contextual information
- **Documentation**: Added code comments and design rationale
- **Test Coverage**: Expanded test coverage for edge cases

### 4. Future Improvements

Planned enhancements to the UTXO selection include:

- Integration with Lightning Network channel funding
- Enhanced privacy features (CoinJoin compatibility)
- Machine learning optimization for fee/confirmation time predictions
- Support for advanced Bitcoin features (taproot, etc.)

## Security Model

The UTXO selection module has the following security boundaries:

1. Maintains integrity of UTXO data
2. Ensures appropriate fee calculation
3. Prevents creation of invalid transactions
4. Protects against various Bitcoin-specific attacks

## Related Components

The UTXO selection system interacts with:

- Wallet database for UTXO information
- Network module for fee estimation
- Key management for signing
- Transaction broadcast system

## Conclusion

The BitVault UTXO selection implementation provides a robust, efficient, and secure method for creating Bitcoin transactions with optimal input selection.
