# BitVault Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the BitVault wallet application, providing a high-level overview of its components and their interactions.

## Overview

The BitVault wallet architecture consists of several key components, each with specific responsibilities:

- **Core Components**
  - Key Management Module - Handles cryptographic operations and secrets
  - UTXO Management System - Manages Bitcoin UTXOs and transaction building
  - Platform Abstractions - Provides platform-specific functionality
  - Configuration System - Manages wallet settings and preferences

- **Cross-cutting Concerns**
  - Event System - Enables loose coupling between components
  - Logging Framework - Provides secure, contextual logging
  - Error Handling - Consistent error propagation and handling
  - Security Boundaries - Clear separation of security domains

## Component Interactions

Components interact primarily through a well-defined event system that respects security boundaries. The event-driven architecture (described in detail in [Event Architecture](event_architecture.md)) ensures:

1. Loose coupling between components
2. Clear communication patterns
3. Testability of component interactions
4. Security boundary enforcement

### Communication Flow Example

A typical communication flow for a transaction:

1. User Interface → Event System: "Create Transaction" request
2. Event System → UTXO Manager: Request for UTXO selection
3. UTXO Manager → Event System: Selected UTXOs
4. Event System → Key Manager: Request for transaction signing
5. Key Manager → Event System: Signed transaction
6. Event System → Network Module: Transaction broadcast

## Security Model

Security is a primary concern in the BitVault architecture. The wallet implements several security patterns:

- **Explicit Security Boundaries** - Clear demarcation between security domains
- **Minimal Privilege** - Components only have access to what they need
- **Memory Protection** - Secure handling of cryptographic secrets
- **Defensive Coding** - Validation at trust boundaries
- **Event Security** - Security-aware event propagation

See [Security Boundaries](../security/security_boundaries.md) for detailed information on security implementation.

## Module Structure

The codebase is organized into the following major modules:

- **bitvault-common** - Core functionality shared across platforms
  - `key_management.rs` - Cryptographic keys and secrets management
  - `utxo_management.rs` - UTXO handling and transaction building
  - `platform/` - Platform-specific abstractions
  - `events.rs` - Event system implementation
  - `types.rs` - Core data types
  - `error.rs` - Error types and handling

- **bitvault-ui** - User interface implementation
- **bitvault-node** - Bitcoin node interaction
- **bitvault-app** - Application entry points for different platforms

## Cross-platform Strategy

BitVault is designed for cross-platform compatibility:

- Core functionality in Rust for security and performance
- Platform-specific code isolated in dedicated modules
- UI adaptations for different platforms while maintaining core experience
- Consistent security model across all platforms

## Future Directions

The architecture is designed to accommodate future enhancements:

1. Lightning Network integration
2. Hardware wallet support
3. Multi-signature wallet support
4. Advanced privacy features
