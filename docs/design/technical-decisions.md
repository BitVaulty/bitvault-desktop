- Defense-in-depth approach aligns with Bitcoin security best practices

**Implementation Impact**:
- Increased development complexity for process isolation
- Additional security verification and testing requirements
- Platform-specific adaptations needed for non-Linux environments
- Clear security benefits justify the implementation cost

### TDR-016: Security-Aware Logging Implementation

**Decision**: Implement a structured, security-aware logging system that sanitizes sensitive data, categorizes logs by security context, and provides both human-readable and machine-parseable output.

**Context**: 
- Logging is essential for debugging and monitoring, but can expose sensitive information
- Bitcoin wallets handle highly sensitive cryptographic material
- Different log contexts have different security requirements

### TDR-018: Memory Security for Sensitive Data

**Date:** 2023-08-12

### Context

BitVault manages sensitive cryptographic material such as private keys, seed phrases, and transaction signing data. This data must be protected not only in storage and transit but also while in memory. Memory-based attacks can extract sensitive information from RAM through various techniques such as cold boot attacks and memory dumping.

### Decision

Implement dedicated types for handling sensitive data with automatic memory zeroing:

1. Create a `SensitiveString` type for textual sensitive data (seed phrases, passwords)
2. Create a `SensitiveBytes` type for binary sensitive data (private keys, raw signatures)
3. Use the `zeroize` crate to clear memory when these types are dropped
4. Implement custom `Debug` and `Display` traits to prevent accidental logging

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual memory management**: Requiring developers to manually clear sensitive data from memory. Rejected because it's error-prone and difficult to enforce consistently.

2. **Relying on the OS/language**: Assuming Rust's memory safety and OS memory protection is sufficient. Rejected because specialized types provide an additional layer of protection and make security considerations more explicit.

3. **Hardware-based security (TEE/HSM)**: Using Trusted Execution Environments or Hardware Security Modules. Considered for future implementation but not as a replacement for in-memory protection.

### Implementation

The implementation consists of:

1. Wrapper types that implement `Zeroize` and `ZeroizeOnDrop` from the `zeroize` crate
2. Custom Debug/Display implementations that hide the actual content
3. Methods to access the inner content only when necessary
4. Explicit documentation of security considerations

```rust
// Example implementation
#[derive(Clone, Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop)]
pub struct SensitiveString {
    inner: String,
}

// Custom Display implementation that redacts content
impl fmt::Display for SensitiveString {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "[redacted sensitive string]")
    }
}
```

### Security Implications

- **Positive**: Reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure from memory dumps
- **Positive**: Makes it harder to accidentally log sensitive information
- **Positive**: Creates clear security boundaries in the code
- **Limitation**: Does not protect against all types of memory attacks
- **Limitation**: Protection only exists while the data is wrapped in these types

### Bitcoin Considerations

Bitcoin private keys and seed phrases are high-value targets. Compared to regular applications, cryptocurrencies face significantly higher motivation for attacks due to the potential immediate financial gain. The irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions means that compromised keys can instantly lead to asset loss.

### Trade-offs

- **Performance Impact**: Minor overhead from additional memory operations
- **Development Complexity**: Slightly more complex code when working with sensitive data
- **Usability vs. Security**: Explicit operations needed to access raw data, which may be less convenient but enforces security considerations

### TDR-019: Type-Safe Validation for Bitcoin Data

**Date:** 2023-08-12

### Context

Bitcoin operations involve various data types with specific validation rules, such as addresses, transaction IDs, amounts, and fees. Invalid data can lead to transaction errors, loss of funds, or security vulnerabilities.

### Decision

Implement domain-specific types with built-in validation for Bitcoin-specific data:

1. Create a `BitcoinAmount` type that enforces valid amounts (non-negative, doesn't exceed supply)
2. Implement the `Address` type with validation rules for different address formats
3. Use strong typing to prevent misuse of different units (satoshis vs BTC)
4. Provide consistent error handling for invalid values

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Runtime validation**: Validating values at runtime without type safety. Rejected because it's error-prone and puts the burden on the developer to remember to validate.

2. **Using primitives directly**: Working with raw strings, integers, etc. Rejected because it makes code more error-prone and obscures the domain logic.

3. **External validation libraries only**: Relying solely on external Bitcoin libraries for validation. Rejected because our application needs consistent error handling and additional application-specific validation.

### Implementation

The implementation includes:

1. Types that encapsulate Bitcoin-specific data with validation on creation
2. Methods to safely perform operations on these types
3. Consistent error handling for invalid values
4. Clear conversion between different units

```rust
// Example implementation
pub struct BitcoinAmount {
    value_sat: u64,
    unit: BitcoinUnit,
}

impl BitcoinAmount {
    pub fn from_satoshis(value_sat: u64) -> Result<Self, WalletError> {
        if value_sat > MAX_SATOSHIS {
            return Err(WalletError::ExceedsMaxSupply);
        }
        
        Ok(Self {
            value_sat,
            unit: BitcoinUnit::Bitcoin,
        })
    }
    
    pub fn from_btc(btc: Decimal) -> Result<Self, WalletError> {
        if btc < Decimal::ZERO {
            return Err(WalletError::NegativeAmount);
        }
        // Additional validation...
    }
}
```

### Security Implications

- **Positive**: Reduces chance of logic errors leading to fund loss
- **Positive**: Makes security constraints explicit in the type system
- **Positive**: Ensures consistent validation across the application
- **Positive**: Makes it harder to accidentally misuse Bitcoin primitives

### Bitcoin Considerations

Bitcoin has specific constraints and validation rules that differ from regular applications:

- Strict formatting requirements for addresses
- Different address formats with different validation rules
- Specific limits on amounts (21 million BTC maximum supply)
- Precision requirements (satoshi as smallest unit)

### Trade-offs

- **Development Speed**: Additional upfront effort to create and use these types
- **API Complexity**: More types to learn and understand
- **Performance**: Minor overhead from validation checks
- **Dependency Management**: Potential coupling to specific Bitcoin libraries

## 3. Bitcoin Implementation Decisions

### TDR-007: 2-of-3 Threshold Signature Scheme as Default

## TDR-020: Cross-Platform Design for Security

**Date:** 2023-08-15

### Context

BitVault needs to run on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows, potentially mobile) while maintaining strong security guarantees. Each platform has different capabilities, security features, and conventions that must be accommodated.

### Decision

Implement a platform abstraction layer that:

1. Detects platform capabilities at compile time and runtime
2. Provides platform-specific implementations for security-critical functionality
3. Uses the best available security features on each platform
4. Follows platform conventions for file locations, permissions, and user interfaces

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Lowest-common-denominator approach**: Using only features available on all platforms. Rejected because this would prevent using important security capabilities on platforms that support them.

2. **Third-party cross-platform libraries**: Using libraries like KeyRing or cross-platform secure storage solutions. Partially adopted for specific functions, but we need more granular control over security-critical functionality.

3. **Platform-specific code branches**: Having separate codebases for each platform. Rejected due to maintenance overhead and code duplication.

### Implementation

The implementation consists of:

1. A `platform` module that detects and abstracts platform-specific functionality:
   - Secure memory management (mlock on Unix, VirtualLock on Windows)
   - Directory locations following platform conventions
   - Platform capability detection at runtime

2. A build script (`build.rs`) that sets compile-time feature flags:
   - Platform identification
   - Available security features
   - Build information

3. Conditional compilation to select the appropriate implementation:

```rust
#[cfg(unix)]
fn secure_memory_lock(ptr: *const u8, len: usize) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Unix-specific implementation using mlock
}

#[cfg(windows)]
fn secure_memory_lock(ptr: *const u8, len: usize) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Windows-specific implementation using VirtualLock
}
```

### Security Implications

- **Positive**: Utilizes the best available security features on each platform
- **Positive**: Provides consistent security guarantees regardless of platform
- **Positive**: Follows platform conventions for sensitive data storage
- **Negative**: Increases code complexity which could lead to bugs
- **Negative**: Requires thorough testing across all supported platforms

### Bitcoin Considerations

Bitcoin wallets are high-value targets across all platforms. Different platforms have different security architectures, and BitVault must adapt to take advantage of each:

- **macOS/iOS**: Secure Enclave for key management
- **Windows**: DPAPI for data protection
- **Linux**: Memory protection and filesystem permissions
- **Mobile**: Hardware-backed keystores and secure elements

### Trade-offs

- **Development Complexity**: More complex code and build system
- **Maintenance Burden**: Need to keep up with platform security changes
- **Testing Requirements**: Must test thoroughly on each supported platform
- **Feature Parity**: Some security features may not be available on all platforms

## TDR-021: BDK Integration for Bitcoin Functionality

### Context

The BitVault wallet needs robust, secure Bitcoin functionality including transaction creation, signing, fee estimation, and address handling. We could either implement these features from scratch or use an existing library.

### Decision

We will use Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) as the foundation for all Bitcoin-specific functionality in BitVault rather than implementing custom Bitcoin handling logic.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Implementation**: Building Bitcoin functionality from scratch would give maximum control but would require significant development effort and thorough security auditing.
2. **Multiple Libraries**: Using separate libraries for different Bitcoin functions would create integration complexity and potential inconsistencies.
3. **Other Wallet Libraries**: Libraries like Electrum or bitcoinj (via JNI) were considered but rejected due to language mismatch and security considerations.

### Implementation Details

- Use BDK for all core Bitcoin functionality:
  - Key management and derivation (BIP32/39/44/49/84/86)
  - Transaction building and signing
  - Address generation and validation
  - Fee estimation
  - UTXO management
  
- Create thin wrapper types that add our app-specific extensions on top of BDK types:
  - `AddressInfo` wraps BDK's `Address` with UI metadata
  - `WalletTransaction` wraps BDK's `TransactionDetails` with memo and UI data
  
- Use direct BDK APIs where possible rather than recreating functionality:
  - Use `bitcoin::Amount` for Bitcoin amount handling
  - Use BDK's `FeeRate` for fee calculations
  - Use BDK's descriptor wallet for wallet operations

### Security Implications

#### Positive
- BDK is well-audited, developed by Bitcoin experts, and widely used
- Reduces risk of subtle cryptographic errors in custom implementations
- Standardizes security practices across the wallet
- Automatic updates for critical security issues in Bitcoin protocol

#### Negative
- Creates external dependency that must be regularly updated
- Requires thorough understanding of BDK's security model

### Bitcoin Considerations

BDK handles Bitcoin-specific considerations correctly, including:

- Proper address format validation for different networks
- BIP standard implementations for key derivation
- Fee estimation based on transaction weight
- UTXO selection and coin control
- Support for all address types (Legacy, SegWit, Taproot)
- Network-specific validations

### Trade-offs

- **Development Speed**: Much faster development compared to custom implementation
- **Code Size**: Reduced code size for Bitcoin-specific functionality
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain as Bitcoin protocol evolves
- **Flexibility**: Some loss of flexibility for custom requirements
- **Dependency Management**: Requires staying updated with BDK releases

### TDR-009: Sensitive Data Handling

**Decision**: Implement `SensitiveString` and `SensitiveBytes` to automatically zero out sensitive data upon drop.

**Context**: Protect sensitive data like private keys and passwords from memory leaks.

**Rationale**: Ensures sensitive data is not left in memory, reducing the risk of exposure through memory dumps.

**Security Implications**: Enhances memory protection by ensuring sensitive data is cleared from memory when no longer needed.

### TDR-010: Secure Logging Infrastructure

### TDR-011: Configuration Management with TOML

**Decision**: Use TOML for configuration with validation and default values.

**Context**: Configuration files are necessary for managing application settings.

**Rationale**: Provides a human-readable format with strong validation capabilities.

**Security Implications**: Ensures configuration settings are valid and secure by default.

### TDR-012: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Employ a comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and doctests.

**Context**: Testing is critical for ensuring the reliability and security of the codebase.

**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing helps catch bugs early and ensures code quality.

**Security Implications**: Enhances code reliability and security by validating functionality and catching potential issues.
