# BitVault Recovery and Backup Design

This document outlines the comprehensive backup and recovery strategy for BitVault, ensuring users can recover Bitcoin funds under various loss scenarios. Given that the loss of keys in a Bitcoin wallet can lead to permanent loss of funds, robust backup and recovery mechanisms are essential security features.

## 1. Backup Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple independent backup mechanisms with overlapping coverage
- **Usability vs. Security Balance**: Making secure backup processes user-friendly without compromising security
- **Verification-Focused**: All backups must be verified multiple times before relying on them
- **Graceful Degradation**: Recovery possible even with partial backup materials or compromised environments
- **Guided Procedures**: Step-by-step guidance for critical backup operations with error prevention
- **Clear Documentation**: Explicit user guidance on secure backup storage with context-specific recommendations
- **Redundancy by Design**: No single point of failure in backup mechanisms
- **Recovery Resilience**: Multiple paths to recover under various compromise scenarios

### 2-of-3 Threshold Signature Advantage

BitVault's 2-of-3 threshold signature architecture provides inherent redundancy and security advantages:

- **Compromise Resistance**: Funds secure even if one key share is compromised
- **Loss Tolerance**: Wallet recoverable even if one key share is permanently lost
- **Flexible Recovery**: Multiple valid key share combinations for recovery
- **Defense in Depth**: Key shares stored in different security domains
- **Progressive Security**: Additional key shares can enhance security without changing wallet structure

## 2. Key Share Backup Strategy

### Device Key Share

The device key share resides on the user's primary device within the secure boundary.

**Backup Approach**:
